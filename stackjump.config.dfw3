## Use lspci to find out what your bus order for NICS, for proper bonding.  Examples:
## Below used for parallels VM
#BUSORDER='"0000:00:05.0","0000:00:06.0","0000:00:07.0","0000:00:08.0"'
## Below used for virtualbox VM
#BUSORDER='"0000:00:03.0","0000:00:08.0","0000:00:09.0","0000:00:0a.0"'
## Below example used for quanta real hardware bus addresses
#BUSORDER='"0000:06:00.0","0000:06:00.1","0000:03:00.0","0000:03:00.1"'
## Dell R720
BUSORDER='"0000:01:00.0","0000:01:00.1","0000:44:00.0","0000:41:00.0"'
